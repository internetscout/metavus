<h1>Rebuild Recommender Database</h1>

<p><b>Note:</b> Manually rebuilding the recommender database can take a
<b>long time</b>, hours for a large collection, and your browser window must
remain open on the progress page until the rebuild is complete.</p>

<p>The <i>Rebuild Recommender Database</i> page allows administrators to
manually rebuild the recommender database. The recommendation system tries to
provide meaningful suggestions for resources that a user may find interesting or
useful. Because they are dependent on part on user activity, recommendations are
only available to registered users.</p>

<p>Information in the recommender database is updated automatically whenever a
user rates a resource record. Rebuilding the recommender database is unnecessary
except when upgrading to a new version of
<abbr title="Collection Workflow Integration System">CWIS</abbr> to take
advantage of any improvements to the recommender engine or when recommendations
seem inaccurate. Recommendations will be
less meaningful while the recommender database is rebuilt.</p>

<p>The recommender system considers the content of metadata fields that are
configured to be included in keyword searches, and the search weight setting for
those fields â€“ the higher the search weight for a field, the more it influences
recommendations.</p>

<p>The recommender database can be rebuilt in either the foreground or
background. Rebuilding the recommender database in the foreground requires that
the web browser remain on the page until the rebuild is complete, but it
provides a completion time estimate and current status. Rebuilding the
recommender database in the background uses background tasks and does not
require that the web browser remain on the page. It does not provide a
completion time estimate or current status due to the nature of background
tasks, but is highly recommended because rebuilding the recommender database can
take a very long time and background tasks are less performance intensive.</p>
