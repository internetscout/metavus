The GoogleMaps plugin provides a way to display geographic data culled
from your CWIS installation on a google map.

In the simplest use case, where all you want is to place a map
somewhere in your interface with point data on the map plotted from
either a Point metadata field which contains Lat/Long data, or a text
metadata field which contains street addresses, you will need to:

1. Select the desired Metadata field in the GoogleMaps plugin
configuration.

2. Insert the following in your UI files where you want the map
displayed:
<?PHP
$AF = ApplicationFramework::getInstance();
$AF->SignalEvent("GoogleMaps_EVENT_HTML_TAGS_SIMPLE");
?>

For explanations of how to do more complex things, like providing
custom marker stylings, or allowing multiple sets of markers, see the
comments in GoogleMaps.php.
