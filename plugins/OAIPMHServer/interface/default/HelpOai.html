    <dt>What is OAI-PMH?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting
      (OAI-PMH) is a format for exchanging metadata records in a
      standardized and machine-parseable way.  If you choose to enable
      the OAI server plugin, then your CWIS site will also be an OAI
      Repository from which others can pull records.

      <p>Wikipedia's
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Archives_Initiative"
         >Open Archives Initiative</a> page gives a more detailed summary
      of the OAI project, and more technical data on OAI-PMH can be
      obtained from the
      <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html"
         >OAI-PMH protocol definition</a>
    </dd>

    <dt>What is XSD?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>OAI-PMH provides data in an XML dialect.  While this
      can be helpful in that there are numerous tools to work with XML
      data, it can also be problematic in that XML is so extensible
      that it can be difficult to interpret.  XSD a schema description
      language which can be used to define the structure of an XML
      document (see <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSD">Wikipedia: XSD</a> for
      mor detail).

      <p>CWIS can serve OAI data in a number of standard formats, and has
      an XSD avaialble for each of those formats.

      <p>If you choose to define a custom data format, then CWIS can
      generate an XSD for you to use. To use this facility, specify
      {CWIS_ROOT}/index.php?P=P_OAIPMHServer_XSD&amp;FN={FORMAT_NAME}
      as the Schema Defintion URL when you define or edit your custom
      format.  {CWIS_ROOT} should be replaced by the base URL of your
      site, and {FORMAT_NAME} should be replaced by the name of your
      custom format.

      <p>The generated XSD will use &lt;xs:include&gt; elements to incorporate
      namespaces defined by your schema.  When you have a field which
      supports multiple qualifiers, CWIS will attempt to compose them with
      an &lt;xs:union&gt;.  Depending on which qualifiers must be composed in this
      way, and which validation tools are employed, this may result in an
      XSD which fails to validate.

      <p>Note that differing XSD validation suites will often give different
      calidation results and that some of the more popular XML software,
      most notably libxml2, contains incomplete or non-compliant XSD
      validation functionality.  Therefore, if your schema includes fields
      which compose multiple namespaces, then getting your XSD to validate
      in a cross-parser way may be difficult.  In this case, your best
      option may be to use the CWIS-generated XSD as a starting point which
      can be refined.
